# calculator

A simple project created with HTML/CSS/JS as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
Meant to emulate the behaviour of a simple Casio calculator (limited space to display results, having to adjust the number of decimals displayed to fit the screen). Dont't try to divide by zero!
